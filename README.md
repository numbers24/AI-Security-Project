# AI-Security-Project
A collection of AI security projects

Problem 1: Uses FoolBox to implement 10 different attacks on the ResNet-18 model, and 
compares their effects including 
  1) attack success rate
  2) different p-norm distances 
  3) time cost of each attack
  
Problem 2:  Implements a FGSM based attack to generate adversarial 
examples that work on multiple models including ResNet-18, MobileNet, VGG-19 and 
AlexNet. Reords effects including
  1) attack success rates for different models
  2) average p-norm distances for 10 inputs
  3) time cost of your attack.
  4) accuracy of the attack
  
Problem 4: Poisons the CIFAR-10 dataset to create a ResNet-18 model with backdoors.
Relates accuracy of the model's predictions before and after the backdoor is inserted.

Problem 5: Creates a Deepfake Video
